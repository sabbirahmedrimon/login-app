# login-app
This small app will be used to login a page. I am creating it by using Node.js, Express, React and MongoDB. 
# please install these packages before running the code
 1) git clone https://github.com/sabbirahmedrimon/login-app.git
 2) in login-app(in react app) folder -> npm install
 3) in backend folder -> sudo install -g nodemon
 4) in backend folder -> npm install mongodb
 then from backend folder please write on colsole 'nodemon server' that will connect you with MongoDB
 and then from login-app(react) please write 'npm start.
 Now you will see http://localhost:3000/ is runnning on the browser. 
 You can easily signup, login and logout there.
